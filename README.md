<summary><b>Task 1:</b> Install the RISC-V toolchain using the VDI. Write a simple C program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n, compile it using the GCC compiler, and check the output. Then, compile the same code using the RISC-V GCC compiler to analyze its generated instructions..</summary>

### WHAT IS RISC-V?
RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC). Unlike proprietary ISAs, RISC-V is free and open, allowing anyone to use, modify, or implement it without licensing fees. 

It is designed to be simple, extensible, and modular, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from small embedded systems to high-performance computing. RISC-V's flexibility and openness have made it a popular choice for academic research, startups, and companies looking for custom hardware solutions.
