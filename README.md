<summary><b>Task 1:</b> Install the RISC-V toolchain using the VDI. Write a simple C program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n, compile it using the GCC compiler, and check the output. Then, compile the same code using the RISC-V GCC compiler to analyze its generated instructions.</summary>

***WHAT IS RISC-V?***
  
>RISC-V  is an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) principles.  RISC-V is a free and open architecture. It is designed to be simple, extensible, and modular, making it suitable for various applications, from small embedded systems to high-performance computing.

## 1. Download the Virtual Disk Image and Install it using Oracle VM Box

## 2. Write a simple C program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n

## 3. Compile the C code using the GCC compiler, and check the output
```
cd
```
open the sum1ton.c code 
```

leafpad sum1ton.c
```
compile it using gcc compiler 
```
gcc sum1ton.c
```
run the code using the ./a.out
```
./a.out
```

## 4. Compile the C code using the RISC V Processor, and check the output

  the below command compiles the c program using risc v compiler
  
    riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o 1ton.o 1ton.c

  This command generates an assembly code for the program

    riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d 1ton.o

  now we have to locate the main section

    /main

Observations in Assembly Instructions

          The byte address for the main was found to be 10184.
          There were 15 instructions (in hexadecimal: E) when compiled with the -O1 optimization level.
          The address of each consecutive instruction increments by 4 bytes, as observed in the disassembled output.
          
The same commands were run with the -Ofast optimization level instead of -O1, resulting in a reduced number of instructionsâ€”12.

     o This demonstrates that the number and type of assembly instructions generated depend on the compilation optimization level used.
     o The higher optimization (-Ofast) produces a more compact and efficient assembly.

1. **R-Type (Register-to-Register)**  
- **Purpose**: Used for arithmetic and logical operations involving only registers.  
- **Fields**: `opcode`, `rd` (destination register), `funct3`, `rs1` (source register 1), `rs2` (source register 2), `funct7`.  
- **Example**: `add rd, rs1, rs2`.
  
2. **I-Type (Immediate)**  
- **Purpose**: Instructions involving immediate values, such as arithmetic with a constant or memory load.  
- **Fields**: `opcode`, `rd`, `funct3`, `rs1`, `imm` (immediate value).  
- **Example**: `addi rd, rs1, imm`.

3. **S-Type (Store)**  
- **Purpose**: Used for store operations (writing data to memory).  
- **Fields**: `opcode`, `imm` (split into two parts), `rs1`, `rs2`, `funct3`.  
- **Example**: `sw rs2, imm(rs1)`.

4. **B-Type (Branch)**  
- **Purpose**: Used for conditional branch instructions.  
- **Fields**: `opcode`, `imm` (split into multiple parts), `rs1`, `rs2`, `funct3`.  
- **Example**: `beq rs1, rs2, imm`.

5. **U-Type (Upper Immediate)**  
- **Purpose**: Used to load a 20-bit upper immediate value into the destination register.  
- **Fields**: `opcode`, `rd`, `imm` (20 bits).  
- **Example**: `lui rd, imm`

6. **J-Type (Jump)**  
- **Purpose**: Used for jump instructions.
