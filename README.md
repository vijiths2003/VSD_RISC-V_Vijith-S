<summary><b>Task 1:</b> Install the RISC-V toolchain using the VDI. Write a simple C program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n, compile it using the GCC compiler, and check the output. Then, compile the same code using the RISC-V GCC compiler to analyze its generated instructions..</summary>

#### WHAT IS RISC-V?
>RISC-V  is an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) principles.  RISC-V is a free and open architecture. It is designed to be simple, extensible, and modular, making it suitable for various applications, from small embedded systems to high-performance computing.
